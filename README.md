## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetching, Storing, Deleting API locally

### What I learned

This is an IP addresss tracker where it can track your location based off your IP address or your domain. The focus of this project was to implement different JavaScript methods, which includes creating a variable for each element and then making a function with those variables to create responsive. There is also 2 separate API's that was fetched in this project. This project was quite challenging for me, but I learned a lot from building this project. I broke down the project into smaller pieces and then connect them all together. Storing each factors into a variable and work each variable through function and then show the result through DOM manipulation. 

### Continued development

In this project, I briefly got into restFUl API using fetch. In the future, I really want to focus more on building a CRUD app using HTTP protocol of Post, Get, Put, Delete.
